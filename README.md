# Varnish

Docker image based on official Varnish Cache image, adding prometheus exporter [Prometheus Varnish Exporter](https://github.com/jonnenauha/prometheus_varnish_exporter) and the ability to query MaxMind databases leveraging [libvmod-geoip2](https://github.com/varnishcache-friends/libvmod-geoip2)

### Overview

This image is built from Varnish Cache official image, and installs this exporter.
The aim of this image is to be used in a Varnish deployment both as `varnishd` and as exporter, to ensure that the same varnish version is used.

It is designed to run as Kubernetes Pod sidecar in a Varnish Pod and is used in Softonic's [Varnish helm chart](https://github.com/softonic/varnish-chart), the only requirement is to share `/var/lib/varnish`.
